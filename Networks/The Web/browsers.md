### What all consist of web data that gets stored in user's web-browser?

1. üç™**Cookies** - It's a small text sent from a website to a user's web-browser containing user's info about their site preferences and login creds and then use that info to enhance UX when user visits the website next time. Why it is called a cookie? well, early designers thought that like a real üç™, a web cookie is small, and customizable to user's preferences. It doesn't make that sense to me. If I've get to rename anything I'll rename cookies to 'keychains', or 'tee' or may be 'jewelry' that comes in various sizes and designs with different gemstones, metals and even personalized engravings. üòù

2. **üß†Cache** - Websites can push copy of frequently used images and files (incl. webpages) in to your browser's memory and for this purpose browsers have temporary storage called cache. Which is basically what...a little share of your system disk storage??? I've not dug further on this. This is usually in MBs say 10-20 MBs, well that depends on for how long you've running your browser (and how long back you cleared-up the browsing data). Why cache is important? It's a talk in itself.

3. **üîÑAutofills** (aka Form Data) - when user fills out a form (rather whole page filled with I/O boxes, the form could also mean even one input field) on a website, the browser stores that data (called form data) so as to prompt when user goes on to fill the same or similar form. This helps user to fill the form quickly with minimum/no changes.

4. **‚öôÔ∏èSite settings** - Basically a user-customizable cookie! It lets user control their permissions and preferences, such as website's access to their location, microphone, or camera, and whether the site is allowed. IDK whey they didn't termed it 'home decor'.

5. **‚ÑπÔ∏è Hosted app data** - Assumingly an idea by Chromebook designers, it is the data stored by 'web-apps' that in-turn installed as 'hosted app' in the user's browser and functions like a native app, but only on the web-browser. Interestingly, the hosted app could even function when you're offline, if the app is designed for such intents and purposes.

### ü§îWhy cache is important for web browser?
Like usual offline desktop apps such as Calculator, Clock, or File Explorer, a web-browser is also an app and all apps demand some processing time and space from the processor (CPU). When you deal with the processing space, cache comes into picture. So, cache is actually processor's memory that stores frequently used data by the processor for temporary time. Now, as the data stored is temporary, not that huge and it is to be accessed quickly by the processor, it makes total sense to use RAM for this purpose for it is volatile and sits in close proximity to the CPU. You close the browser or shut down the device, the cache is cleaned-up.

Now a days, some web caches may also use non-volatile storages such as the C drive on Windows PC. This is done to store data for longer periods of time, even when the device is restarted. But this comes at a cost i.e. it's slowwwww.
