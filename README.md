Technologies  
- `SSL` (aka `TLS` since 1999) - a network protocol that is designed for protecting the transmission of data between two parties with authentication and encryption. This transmission is usually between a userâ€™s web browser and the server of the website they are visiting. Installing an SSL certificate on a website allows you to enable HTTPS. Remember that the green padlock in the browsers tells visitors that your website is safe. Runs on port 443
- `SSH` or Secure Shell, offers a secure way to log in to another computer remotely and issue commands. Transferring data over an encrypted SSH connection is called SSH tunneling. Through this, you can create an encrypted remote connection to your website. Of course, authentication through password/username, or a set of cryptographic private/public keys, is necessary to keep it secure. After the authentication, you can access any information securely (e.g., files and database of your site) and issue commands to the remote server using a command line. Runs on port 22
